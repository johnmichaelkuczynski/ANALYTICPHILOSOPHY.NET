# Ask A Philosopher - Philosophical Q&A Application

## Recent Updates (November 2025)
- **Wilhelm Reich Integration**: Added as 47th philosopher with complete works (1,456 chunks from 6 books covering character analysis, orgone energy, sexual economy, and mass psychology)
- **Critical Production Fixes**: 
  - Fixed conversation leak bug where messages appeared across all philosophers (added React key prop to force remounting)
  - Fixed input persistence bug where questions stuck when switching figures (added state reset on figure change)
  - Fixed quote refusal bug with mandatory quote provision rule (philosophers must provide quotes when requested)

## Overview
"Ask A Philosopher" is a philosophical Q&A application designed for deep philosophical discourse with 47 philosophical and literary figures. It leverages their actual writings and advanced AI to provide nuanced and contextually rich responses. The platform integrates philosophical papers as foundational texts, enabling the AI to reason and adapt based on user sophistication. It supports multi-author conversations through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, ensuring each figure's responses are grounded in their respective works. The project aims to offer an accessible and engaging way to explore complex philosophical ideas and literary works, with J.-M. Kuczynski as the default philosopher. The project's ambition is to offer a robust platform for exploring complex philosophical and literary concepts, enhancing understanding through direct engagement with the 'minds' of history's great thinkers, and has significant market potential in education and intellectual discourse.

## User Preferences
- **Response Length Control**: User can type desired response length in words, or leave blank for Auto mode. In Auto mode, philosophers MUST produce 3-5 substantial paragraphs separated by blank lines with multi-layered attack structure: Opening (immediate attack/reframing, 1 para), Mechanism (1-3 paragraphs deploying MULTIPLE layers of distinctive method within these paragraphs - e.g., Nietzsche: genealogy + psychological diagnosis + cultural prognosis + hammer-blow rhetoric combined in 1-3 paras; Marx: material base + class dynamics + dialectic + economic mechanisms; Spinoza: geometric proof + causal necessity + modal analysis + ethical implications), Counterattack/Implications (turn it around, 1 para), and Conclusion (decisive verdict, brief). Mandatory self-audit before responding: paragraph count (3-5 with blank lines), multiple method layers deployed within paragraphs, genealogical tracing when applicable, mechanism shown not asserted, counterattack present, voice matches philosopher's style (visceral/geometric/analytic/dialectical). Worked example provided in system prompts showing Nietzsche combining multiple layers within single paragraphs. Standard: responses must have HORSEPOWER - depth and force to fully deploy intellectual firepower. Single paragraph or polite summaries = automatic failure
- **Quote Frequency Guidance**: User can adjust discretionary quote usage with three levels: Low (deploy quotes rarely, only when critical), Normal (use quotes occasionally when they advance arguments), High (use quotes 1-2 times per response when tactically useful). Quotes are never mandatory - they're weapons deployed only when they strengthen the philosophical attack.
- **Paper Writing Mode**: Toggle to request formal philosophical papers with academic conventions, proper argumentation, and scholarly language
- **Variation**: Never give the same answer twice.
- **Direct Attack Mandate**: All figures attack problems immediately without preambles, commit decisively without hedging, name specific targets rather than vague references, show mechanisms through visible reasoning, reframe confused questions by rejecting false premises, and deploy quotes as logical weapons rather than decoration.
- **Anti-Chickenshit Directive**: Comprehensive 10-point protocol eliminating defensive, pedagogical, and generic responses. No defensive openings, no teaching about philosophy (USE it instead), no decorative quotes, engage actual challenges (not restate positions), reframe confused questions, counterattack when appropriate, show distinctive method visibly (Spinoza's geometric proofs, Russell's logical analysis, Nietzsche's psychological diagnosis, etc.), commit without hedging, eliminate generic academic voice, and when stuck admit it honestly. Every response tested against quality checklist: Did I attack immediately? Did I USE my philosophy or EXPLAIN it? Did I engage the challenge? Is my distinctive method visible? Could another philosopher have written this? Kuczynski bot serves as gold standard for potent, non-evasive responses.
- **Epistemic Humility Override**: All philosophers are programmed with intellectual honesty protocols requiring them to acknowledge decisive evidence against their positions, admit logical contradictions they cannot resolve, show genuine understanding of challenges, attempt responses using their actual resources, and admit limits when stuck. Intellectual honesty comes FIRST, commitment to views SECOND. Great thinkers update beliefs; defending untenable positions is what mediocrities do.

## System Architecture
**Primary Function**: Centralized knowledge server providing unified access to philosophical and psychoanalytic texts via secure internal API.

**Architecture Transformation (November 2025)**: 
- **Previous**: Dual-pool system with philosopher-specific embeddings (jmk, freud, veblen) + separate Common Fund
- **Current**: Unified knowledge base where ALL texts consolidated into Common Fund (figureId='common')
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for all ZHI applications to query comprehensive philosophical knowledge

The application features a 3-column layout without authentication, providing direct access to the chat interface. It also functions as a secure knowledge provider for the ZHI ecosystem via internal API.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Layout**: A 3-column layout with a far-left column for philosophical figures, a narrow middle sidebar for settings, and a right area for the main chat.
- **Accessibility**: No login required; minimal, visible settings (Response Length, Write a Paper toggle).
- **Visuals**: Animated Kuczynski icon, AI-generated portrait avatars for figures, minimalistic design with elegant typography, and dark mode support.
- **"Talk with X" Feature**: Clickable philosophical figures with avatars for personalized conversations.
- **"Compare Thinkers" Feature**: Allows selecting two philosophers for a side-by-side comparison of their real-time, streaming responses to the same question.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Wouter, TanStack Query, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Express.js with Node.js and Drizzle ORM.
- **AI Interaction**: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the primary AI operating at 0.7 temperature. Figures are configured for **Aggressive Direct Reasoning** using a 6-point mandate (Immediate Attack, Commit Without Hedging, Name Specific Targets, Show Mechanism, Reframe Confused Questions, Quotes as Weapons). Philosophers operate as fully realized, maximally intelligent versions who use their doctrines as frameworks for attacking novel problems, not as textbook entries reciting views. Conversation history maintained; philosophers can cite their own works by title.
- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time word-by-word AI response streaming.
- **Settings**: Users can control response length, quote frequency, and toggle paper writing mode.
- **Paper Writing Feature**: Allows philosophers to write original papers (up to 1500 words) in their authentic voice, utilizing RAG retrieval, with streaming generation and text file download options.
- **Guest User Management**: Session-based storage with auto-generated guest user IDs maintains state without authentication.
- **RAG System**: Papers are chunked (~250 words per chunk), embedded into 1536-dimension vectors using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, and stored in a PostgreSQL database with pgvector. Semantic search retrieves relevant chunks for the LLM. Optimized batch processing (16 chunks per API call) for efficient embedding generation.
- **Unified Knowledge Base**: ALL philosophical texts (Kuczynski, Freud, Jung, James, Veblen, Hegel, Russell, Hobbes, Berkeley, Maimonides, Reich, and 60+ other figures) consolidated into single Common Fund with figureId='common'. Contains **~30,650 chunks across 194 unique works from 66 authors**. Enables comprehensive cross-philosopher semantic search for knowledge serving to external applications. Previous dual-pool architecture replaced with streamlined single-pool retrieval. **Author filtering** implemented with ILIKE partial matching (e.g., "Kuczynski" matches "J.-M. Kuczynski") for precise knowledge retrieval.
- **Integrated Philosophical and Literary Works**: Extensive works from 66 philosophers and literary figures are integrated. Recent additions include **Wilhelm Reich complete works** (1,456 chunks total: Character Analysis [427 chunks], The Cancer Biopathy Vol. II [288 chunks], The Function of the Orgasm Vol. I [243 chunks], People in Trouble Vol. II [194 chunks], The Invasion of Compulsory Sex-Morality [134 chunks], Reich Speaks of Freud [82 chunks] covering character analysis, orgone energy, sexual economy, mass psychology, and bioenergetic medicine), **Math Classics** batch (Oscar Levin's "Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction" ~255 chunks, Felix Klein's "On Riemann's Theory" ~50 chunks, Gauss's "Curved Surfaces" ~110 chunks, Dedekind's "Theory of Numbers" ~33 chunks), George Berkeley's "Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous" (634 chunks), Kuczynski's "Extended Set Theory and Logic with Applications" (485 chunks), "Logic, Set-theory, and Philosophy of Mathematics" (260 chunks), "Propositions: Nature and Structure" (95 chunks), "Dictionary of Analytic Philosophy" (102 chunks), "Conceptual Atomism and the Computational Theory of Mind" (45 chunks), Jung's "Psychology of the Unconscious" (801 chunks), Thomas Hobbes' "Elements of Philosophy" (91 chunks), and works on psychopathology, Kant studies, and contemporary philosophy.
- **Document Upload Feature**: Users can upload text documents (.txt, .md, .doc, .docx, .pdf up to 1MB) for analysis, evaluation, or rewriting by philosophers.
- **ZHI Knowledge Provider Integration**: Secure internal API (`/api/internal/knowledge`) for other ZHI applications to access the philosophical and psychoanalytic knowledge base using HMAC-SHA256 authentication and structured knowledge retrieval. **Every passage includes explicit author attribution** to ensure proper credit for all philosophical works. Implements **COMPREHENSIVE AUTHOR NORMALIZATION + STRICT filtering**: automatically handles ANY variation of 33+ philosopher names (full names, abbreviations, accents, punctuation, case) with bulletproof normalization. **Author Normalization Examples**: "JOHN-MICHAEL KUCZYNSKI" / "j.-m. kuczynski" / "kuczynski" → all normalize to "Kuczynski"; "POINCARÉ" / "henri poincare" → normalize to "Poincare"; "RAMBAM" / "moses maimonides" → normalize to "Maimonides". Diacritic stripping ensures "René Descartes" and "Rene Descartes" match correctly. Returns ONLY the requested author's content (never mixes other authors). **Critical fixes (Nov 2025)**: (1) Comprehensive author normalization with 68+ alias mappings and Unicode diacritic stripping, (2) Intelligent author detection from query text for 33 supported figures, (3) Fixed missing author parameter pass in /zhi/query endpoint, (4) Changed from weak semantic filtering to mandatory author-first retrieval, ensuring 100% accuracy for author-specific queries, (5) **CRITICAL**: Fixed /zhi/query response to use `passage.author` field instead of incorrectly extracting from `paperTitle` - this was causing wrong author attribution in API responses. **75 normalization test cases passing**. Used by EZHW (Epistemic and Zeroth Hypothesis Worldview) application for reliable author-specific knowledge retrieval with zero client-side validation needed.
